SHERLOCK HOLMES.\n\n\nIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\nentered upon my new duties.\n\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\n\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\ntroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\n\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\n\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\nwe started off together in a hansom.\n\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\n\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\nby the time that we reached our destination.\n\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\n\n“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\nas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\nprice.”\n\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\nto-day that has used that expression to me.”\n\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\n\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\nwere too much for his purse.”\n\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\nto being alone.”\n\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\nfor him as a constant companion.”\n\n“Why, what is there against him?”\n\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\n\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\n\n“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\n\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\n\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\n\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\n\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\n\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\nchannels.\n\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\n\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\nresponsible.”\n\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”"

The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\nentered upon my new duties.\n\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\n\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\ntroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\n\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\n\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\nwe started off together in a hansom.\n\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\n\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\nby the time that we reached our destination.\n\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\n\n“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\nas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\nprice.”\n\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\nto-day that has used that expression to me.”\n\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\n\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\nwere too much for his purse.”\n\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\nto being alone.”\n\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\nfor him as a constant companion.”\n\n“Why, what is there against him?”\n\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\n\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\n\n“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\n\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\n\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\n\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\n\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\n\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\nchannels.\n\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\n\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\nresponsible.”\n\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”"

The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\nentered upon my new duties.\n\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\n\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\ntroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\n\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\n\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\nwe started off together in a hansom.\n\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\n\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\nby the time that we reached our destination.\n\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\n\n“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\nas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\nprice.”\n\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\nto-day that has used that expression to me.”\n\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\n\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\nwere too much for his purse.”\n\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\nto being alone.”\n\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\nfor him as a constant companion.”\n\n“Why, what is there against him?”\n\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\n\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\n\n“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\n\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\n\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\n\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\n\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\n\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\nchannels.\n\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\n\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\nresponsible.”\n\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”"

I followed, however, with many\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\nentered upon my new duties.\n\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\n\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\ntroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\n\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\n\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\nwe started off together in a hansom.\n\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\n\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\nby the time that we reached our destination.\n\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\n\n“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\nas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\nprice.”\n\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\nto-day that has used that expression to me.”\n\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\n\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\nwere too much for his purse.”\n\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\nto being alone.”\n\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\nfor him as a constant companion.”\n\n“Why, what is there against him?”\n\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\n\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\n\n“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\n\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\n\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\n\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\n\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\n\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\nchannels.\n\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\n\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\nresponsible.”\n\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”"
